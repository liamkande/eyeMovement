# Follow Mouse Movement

Follow Mouse Movement is a simple JavaScript project that demonstrates the use of mouse events on the DOM. The project includes event listeners that trigger when the user moves their mouse over the web page. As the mouse moves, a small image or icon follows the cursor around the screen, mimicking its movements. This project is a great example of how event listeners can be used to create interactive and engaging web content.
